# IBM_Model
To analyse alignment of semantic features in Chinese and English texts, this project implements the well-known IBM Model 1 and IBM Model 2.

Before making the models works, be sure to run IBM1_tain.py or IBM2_train.py first, so that trained models can be generated and saved in form of txt files.
