# IBM_Model
To analyse alignment of semantic features in Chinese and English texts, this project implements the well-known IBM Model 1 and IBM Model 2.

Before making the models work, make sure IBM1_tain.py and IBM2_train.py have been run first, so that trained models could have been generated and saved in form of txt files.

After that, by changing test examples manunally, performance of these 2 models can be evaluated.
